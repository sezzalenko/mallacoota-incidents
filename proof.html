The 90s were marred with a series of bizzare incidents, causing paranoid thoughts within the family that the town's mame would invoke trouble if spoken outside of holiday time. Hence, we referred to it as Mallafa-fa-fa-fahhh unless we were actually in town.

What happened?

- [[Gipsy Point]]
- [[Awongralea Caravan Park]]
- [[Gaunt's Place]]
- [[Sou'west Arm]]
- [[Melaleuca Grove]]
- [[25 ice creams]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Melaleuca Grove" tags="" position="412,336" size="100,100">In the late 80s, we stayed exclusively at Melaleuca Grove Holiday Units - our entire extended family occupied 4 or 5 units. For some reason, the units made Mum develop kidney stones on two consecutive holidays. 
The nearest hospital is in Orbost, 2-3 hours drive away, and in those days, the only medical service in town was a bush nurse. Both times, Mum and Dad travelled to Orbost, leaving my sister and I behind with our extended family but there was no room in their cars for us. [[Dad's parents]] then drove the 7 hours from Beaumaris to Mallafa-fa-fa-fahhhh so we could finish our holidays and drive us home. 
After the second bout, Mum refused to stay at Melaleuca Grove ever again.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Sou&#39;west Arm" tags="" position="652,336" size="100,100">[[The world's largest and oldest goanna]] terrorised 5 year old me during a picnic at this spot in the Narrows. It followed me to the water, to the firepit, even to the long drop. I climbed onto the highest point I could get to - the wooden green picnic table - and refused to get down because Dad said I was too big to carry.
I thought I was safe - goannas couldn't climb, as far as I knew - until the goanna approached the table and reached its taloned foot up to the bench seat just below me. I screamed and bolted for the car and stayed in its metal safety until my parents recovered from laughing and decided to leave.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="The world&#39;s largest and oldest goanna" tags="" position="652,486" size="100,100">Of course it was not the WORLD's largest and oldest goanna, but we heard later (from someone at the pub) that it may have been the legendary 100-year-old goanna that roamed the national park since the early days of the town. No one knew the average life-span of a goanna, but it certainly //looked// prehistoric enough to be 100 years old.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Dad&#39;s parents" tags="" position="412,486" size="100,100">Nanna and Pa stayed for a few days the first time, and a week the second time. After I asked for a rainbow ice-cream, then felt sick and spewed rainbow spew, they banned rainbow ice-cream forever. My sister was NOT impressed.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Gipsy Point" tags="" position="532,336" size="100,100">On leaving day in 1995, we left town in a convoy and stopped at Gipsy Point for a last drink at the pub.
We all went down to the pier and sat, dangling our legs over the edge, for a last look at the beautiful lake and the bush. Sun streaming down, glittering water, birds singing: it was magical. No one wanted to go back to Melbourne. Eventually, Uncle Pete and his partner Deanne reluctantly began to stand up, triggering the rest of us to do the same. As we groaned and heaved ourselves up, there were a series of sounds: a clinking of keys, a gasp, and a //[[plop.]]//


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="plop." tags="" position="532,486" size="100,100">I think we all assumed the //plop// was a fish: Gipsy Point pier was a great place to watch fish chuck themselves out of the water and //plop// back in. However, when we turned to walk off the pier, we saw Deanne staring into the water, a hand covering her mouth. Uncle Pete asked [[what happened.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="what happened." tags="" position="532,636" size="100,100">She'd put her car keys on the pier next to her as we sat. In getting up, she'd accidently knocked the keys into the water.

Pete and Dad jumped in and duck-dived, trying to find the keys, but to no avail. The ironic thing is that Deanne had attached a floating key-ring for this exact situation, but it had failed brilliantly.

Pete and Deanne had to spend a few days at the Gipsy Point pub waiting for the RACV to be able to come and fashion them a new car key. 

As far as I know, 27 years later, Deanne's keys are still at the bottom of the lake.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Gaunt&#39;s Place" tags="" position="281,339" size="100,100">While staying at this iconic 60s style beach house with views of the inlet, Dad developed a random infection in his pointer finger. On the advice of the bush nurse, he spent the entire two-week holiday with his hand raised, like he was in primary school waiting to be called on.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Awongralea Caravan Park" tags="" position="676,203" size="100,100">In the middle of the night, I fell out of the top bunk of a caravan here when I was 12. It was so dark I couldn't see, so I felt my way back into bed. When I woke up, I thought it was still that dark so I tried to go back to sleep, but my sister was kicking the mattress from the bottom bunk. I realised then that [[I couldn't open my eyes.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="I couldn&#39;t open my eyes." tags="" position="772,353" size="100,100">I freaked out, and mum and dad came running. They were shouting that my eyes had puffed up. I couldn't understand what they meant, so Dad helped me down the bunk ladder and led me to a mirror. I had to physically push my eyelids open to see that they had blown up like balloons. 
They took me to the bush nurse, who examined me for bites and the dreaded pelican itch, but found nothing of the sort. She asked if I was allergic to anything that I knew of, or if I'd eaten anything different or new recently.

And that's how I found out that I'm allergic to a fish called luderick.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="25 ice creams" tags="" position="184,210" size="100,100">As the only children in the family until 1995, my sister and I were routinely spoiled by our aunties and uncles at Christmas, Easter, birthdays, and other special occasions. That's why it was such a shock when, on Christmas Day in 1991, Uncle Pete confessed that he'd forgotten to buy us a Christmas present. To make up for this horrendous crime, he promised to buy us 25 ice-creams during our Mallafa-fa-fa-fahhhh holiday.

To this day, Uncle Pete still owes us 25 of those ice-creams (plus interest).</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
